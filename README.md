# Shadow2hel's Workshop Publisher
Hello everyone! This is officially my first project that I've released to the public, but it's not fully complete yet. Currently it's up for convenience sake and so I can get used to github.
This program is only used for managing addons from Garry's Mod. There's already another program called [gmpu](https://sourceforge.net/projects/garrysmodpublishtool/), but I found this application lacking in certain areas. I decided to improve upon this program, which is why if you run the program you'll notice the layout is exactly the same, and that's intentional.

## Getting started
You can go ahead and download the entire directory and open the .sln link using Visual Studio.
After that it's all up to you!
